# SysOdonto
This project was developed for learning and university assignment purposes. 
The intent was to create an application, using Visual Studio 2017 and C#, to be used by a dental clinic. 

It is a dental clinic management system. The system handles, in the moment, patient data. It uses a postgreSQL DBMS. I think in migrate this project to jsp in the future. 
The name of fields are in Brazilian Portuguese, but I am thinking in internationalisation of the project.

Ideas are welcome.
